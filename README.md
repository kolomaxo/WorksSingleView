# WorksSingleView
Prototype application aggregates and reconciles music works data from different providers. The idea is to get as much data for every music work as possible and avoid data duplication. 

Simple REST service to access stored data by ISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code, itâ€™s a unique musical work identifier) included.
